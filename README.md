# Governance

There are four important functions:

1. Buy GirlScript Tokens
2. Create Proposal
3. Vote Proposal 
4. Execute Proposal 

Emphasis is given to keep people engaged

1. Buying GirlScript tokens helps to fund the DAO, this fund can be used to sponsor gas fees for the voting process thus increasing engagement.

2. Any one can create proposal which requires its duration, funding requested, and percentage to share among voters.

3. Voting on proposal has about 5 different checks. It is made sure that proposer cannot vote, cannot vote passed deadline.

4. Execute Proposal, it can be only executed by the proposer or the owner of contract

Test has been also added to ensure correctness
